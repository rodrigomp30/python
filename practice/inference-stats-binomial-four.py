# Null Hypothesis
# The observed proportion equals the benchmark (15% free trial conversion rate), so the new offer makes no difference.

# How much does the observed proportion deviate from the benchmark?
# Z-score = 5.010, above the typical threshold (~1.96 for 95% confidence)
# showing a strong deviation from the expected 15%—
# this refutes the null hypothesis of no improvement in conversions at MasterClass.

# How likely is this result due to chance?
# p-value = 0.000, far below the 0.05 threshold, 
# confirming statistical significance and reinforcing a real (non-random) increase
# from the trial extension offer.

# What is the range of the true proportion (95% confidence interval)?
# Observed rate = 23.0% (115/500 successes), CI = 19.9% to 100.0%
# The range is entirely above the 15% benchmark, so the true rate is reliably higher.

# How strong is the difference?
# Proportion difference = +8.0% (23.0% - 15%) falls in the small range.
    # Under 5%: Negligible (ignore unless huge sample).
    # 5-10%: Small (worth exploring, noticeable impact).
    # Over 10%: Medium (scale for real gains).
# The offer increases conversions in a small but noticeable way—other factors (e.g., trial length) could build on it.

# What direction should we take based on these results?
# With 23.0% observed rate (vs. 15% benchmark, n=500 users),
# roll out the trial extension offer to all free trials—the reliable CI above 15% shows +4.9-85% gains,
# potentially driving 5-8% more subscriptions and $12K MRR, aligning with B2C SaaS benchmarks for funnel tweaks.
