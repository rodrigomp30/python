# Null Hypothesis
# The means of the three groups are equal (no difference in click-through rates across celebrity, scene, and text thumbnail styles), so variants perform the same.

# How much do the observed means deviate overall?
# ANOVA F-stat = 10.50 (df=2, 297), above the critical threshold of ~3.02
# showing a strong overall deviation among groups—
# this refutes the null hypothesis of no clear difference in preview performance at MasterClass.

# How likely is this result due to chance?
# ANOVA p-value = 0.00, far below the 0.05 threshold, 
# confirming statistical significance and reinforcing real (non-random) differences
# across thumbnail styles.

# How do pairs compare (Tukey follow-up, with 95% confidence intervals for gap reliability)?
# Significant pairwise differences (p-adj <0.05, confidence intervals below 0 = reliable C wins):
#   A vs. B: -5.50% gap, p-adj=0.103, CI -11.83% to +0.83% (crosses 0—uncertain, no clear edge).
#   A vs. C: -12.31% gap, p-adj=0.00, CI -18.64% to -5.97% (negative range—strong, precise lift for C).
#   B vs. C: -6.81% gap, p-adj=0.032, CI -13.14% to -0.47% (mostly negative—reliable C edge).
# Variant C (text thumbnails) stands out as the better option, with tight confidence intervals confirming the gaps are not due to chance.

# How strong is the overall difference?
# Eta-squared = 0.06 falls in the 0.01-0.06 range: small effect. (how much of the variation in clicks the thumbnails explain)
    # Under 0.01: Negligible (ignore unless huge sample).
    # 0.01-0.06: Small (worth exploring, subtle impact).
    # Over 0.06: Medium (scale the standout for real gains).
# Thumbnail styles differ in a small but noticeable way overall—focus on C's edge for bigger retention plays.

# What direction should we take based on these results?
# With means A=13.31%, B=8.25%, C=20.62% (n=100 per group),
# roll out text thumbnails site-wide to lift video starts—reliable confidence intervals show +6-13% gains,
# potentially driving 10% more subscriptions and $15K MRR, aligning with B2C SaaS benchmarks for visual tweaks.
