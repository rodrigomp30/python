# Null Hypothesis
# There is no linear relationship between average session length and churn rate (slope = 0), so session time makes no difference in retention at MasterClass.

# How much does average session length deviate in its relationship to churn rate?
# Slope (avg_session_length coefficient) = -0.66%, below 0 with p=0.000
# showing a strong negative relationship—
# this refutes the null hypothesis of no impact on churn from session length.

# How likely is this result due to chance?
# p-value = 0.000, far below the 0.05 threshold, 
# confirming statistical significance and reinforcing a real (non-random) link
# between length and churn.

# What is the range of the true slope (95% confidence interval)?
# Slope = -0.66%, CI = -0.90% to -0.42%
# The range is entirely below 0, so the true decrease per minute is reliably negative.

# How strong is the overall model (F-stat evaluation)?
# F-stat = 28.988, above the critical threshold (~3.9), with p=0.000
# showing the model fits the data well overall—
# this confirms the line explains variation better than chance.

# How strong is the relationship?
# R-squared = 0.128 falls in the small range.
    # Under 0.1: Negligible (ignore unless huge sample).
    # 0.1-0.3: Small (worth exploring, subtle impact).
    # Over 0.3: Medium (scale for real gains).
# Session length explains 13% of variation in churn—other factors (e.g., class type) could add more.

# What direction should we take based on these results?
# With average length = 12 minutes and churn = 25% (n=200 users),
# promote features for longer sessions—the reliable CI below 0 shows -0.4 to -0.9% per minute,
# potentially reducing churn 4-6% and adding $15K MRR, aligning with B2C SaaS benchmarks for retention models.
