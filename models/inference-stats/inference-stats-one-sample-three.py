# Null Hypothesis
# The sample mean equals the benchmark (25 minutes session duration), so no difference from industry standard.

# How much does the observed mean deviate from the expected?
# t-stat = 4.362 (df=99), well above the critical value threshold of ~1.984
# showing strong deviation from the benchmark—
# this refutes the null hypothesis of no difference in user engagement at MasterClass.

# How likely is this result due to chance?
# p-value = 0.000, far below the 0.05 threshold, 
# confirming statistical significance and reinforcing a real (non-random) improvement
# over the industry average.

# How strong is the difference?
# Cohen's d = 0.438 falls in the 0.2-0.5 range: small-to-medium effect.
    # Under 0.2: Negligible (ignore unless huge sample).
    # 0.2-0.5: Small-to-medium (worth exploring, noticeable impact).
    # Over 0.5: Large (major opportunity).
# Our session durations exceed the benchmark modestly but meaningfully—other factors (e.g., video length) could amplify it for better retention.

# What direction should we take based on these results?
# With sample mean at 27.38 minutes (vs. 25-min benchmark, n=100 users),
# feature this in marketing campaigns to highlight superior engagement—could drive 10-15% more subscription renewals
# by emphasizing "sticky" content, aligning with B2C SaaS benchmarks for user activation.
