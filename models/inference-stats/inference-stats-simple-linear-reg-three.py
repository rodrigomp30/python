# Null Hypothesis
# There is no linear relationship between subject line length and open rate (slope = 0), so length makes no difference in opens at MasterClass.

# How much does subject length deviate in its relationship to open rate?
# Slope (subject_length coefficient) = -1.19%, below 0 with p=0.000
# showing a strong negative relationship—
# this refutes the null hypothesis of no impact on opens from length.

# How likely is this result due to chance?
# p-value = 0.000, far below the 0.05 threshold, 
# confirming statistical significance and reinforcing a real (non-random) link
# between length and opens.

# What is the range of the true slope (95% confidence interval)?
# Slope = -1.19%, CI = -1.46% to -0.93%
# The range is entirely below 0, so the true decrease per word is reliably negative.

# How strong is the overall model (F-stat evaluation)?
# F-stat = 78.974, above the critical threshold (~3.9), with p=0.000
# showing the model fits the data well overall—
# this confirms the line explains variation better than chance.

# How strong is the relationship?
# R-squared = 0.401 falls in the medium range.
    # Under 0.1: Negligible (ignore unless huge sample).
    # 0.1-0.3: Small (worth exploring, subtle impact).
    # Over 0.3: Medium (scale for real gains).
# Subject length explains 40% of variation in opens—other factors (e.g., send time) could add more.

# What direction should we take based on these results?
# With average length = 8 words and open rate = 25% (n=120 campaigns),
# shorten subject lines to 5-6 words to lift opens—the reliable CI below 0 shows -0.9 to -1.5% per word,
# potentially driving 3-5% more opens and $8K MRR, aligning with B2C SaaS benchmarks for email tweaks.
