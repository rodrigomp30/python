# Null Hypothesis
# There is no linear relationship between hours watched and subscription value (slope = 0), so engagement makes no difference in MRR at MasterClass.

# How much does hours watched deviate in its relationship to subscription value?
# Slope (hours_watched coefficient) = $10.49, above 0 with p=0.000
# showing a strong positive relationship—
# this refutes the null hypothesis of no impact on MRR from engagement.

# How likely is this result due to chance?
# p-value = 0.000, far below the 0.05 threshold, 
# confirming statistical significance and reinforcing a real (non-random) link
# between hours and value.

# What is the range of the true slope (95% confidence interval)?
# Slope = $10.49, CI = $9.18 to $11.80
# The range is entirely above 0, so the true increase per hour is reliably positive.

# How strong is the overall model (F-stat evaluation)?
# F-stat = 251.785, above the critical threshold (~3.1), with p=0.000
# showing the model fits the data well overall—
# this confirms the line explains variation better than chance.

# How strong is the relationship?
# R-squared = 0.630 falls in the medium range.
    # Under 0.1: Negligible (ignore unless huge sample).
    # 0.1-0.3: Small (worth exploring, subtle impact).
    # Over 0.3: Medium (scale for real gains).
# Hours watched explains 63% of variation in MRR—other factors (e.g., class type) could add more.

# What direction should we take based on these results?
# With average hours = 5.0 and MRR = $100 (n=150 users),
# promote longer sessions with prompts—the reliable CI above 0 shows $9-12 per hour,
# potentially driving 12% more revenue and $20K MRR, aligning with B2C SaaS benchmarks for engagement models.
