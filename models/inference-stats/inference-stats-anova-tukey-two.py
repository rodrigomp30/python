# Null Hypothesis
# The means of the three groups are equal (no difference in conversion rates across emotional, feature, and neutral pricing copy), so variants perform the same.

# How much do the observed means deviate overall?
# ANOVA F-stat = 0.991 (df=2, 297), below the critical threshold (~3.01)
# showing no strong overall deviation among groups—
# this supports the null hypothesis of no clear difference in funnel performance at MasterClass.

# How likely is this result due to chance?
# ANOVA p-value = 0.110, above the 0.05 threshold, 
# confirming these results are likely due to random chance—no standout variant.

# How do pairs compare (Tukey follow-up)?
# No significant pairwise differences (all p-adj >0.05):
#   A vs. B: 5.06% gap, p=0.438
#   A vs. C: 3.38% gap, p=0.449
#   B vs. C: -1.68% gap, p=1.000
# Groups overlap too much—no clear winner emerges.

# How strong is the overall difference?
# Eta-squared = 0.008 falls in the negligible range.
    # Under 0.01: Negligible (ignore unless huge sample).
    # 0.01-0.06: Small (worth exploring, subtle impact).
    # Over 0.06: Medium-to-large (scale the standout).
# Differences across variants are negligible—other factors (e.g., traffic source) likely drive conversions more.

# What direction should we take based on these results?
# With means A=13.31%, B=8.25%, C=9.93% (n=100 per group),
# no significant differences—pivot to test traffic sources or add n=300 for precision on a potential 4% lift,
# aligning with B2C SaaS benchmarks for multi-variant funnel tweaks.
