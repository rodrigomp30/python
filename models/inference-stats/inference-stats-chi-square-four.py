# Null Hypothesis
# The variables in this analysis are independent, so there is no association between them.

# How much does the observed value deviate from the expected?
# chi2 = 4.402 (df=1), well above the critical value threshold of ~3.841
# showing strong deviation from an independent relationship—
# this refutes the null hypothesis of no link between event types and conversion (purchase).

# How likely is this result due to chance?
# p-value = 0.036, below the 0.05 threshold, 
# confirming statistical significance and reinforcing a real (non-random) connection
# between the variables.

# How strong is the connection?
# Cramér's V = 0.210 falls in the 0.10-0.30 range: small/weak association.
# This reinforces that event type influences purchase conversions modestly—
# worth exploring, but other factors (e.g., user segment) matter too.

# What direction should we take based on these results?
# Overall conversion rate is 31% (24/76) from cart add to checkout,
# with 61% of cart adders advancing and 87% of checkout starters completing purchase.
# Recommendation: Focus on improving the cart-to-checkout step (e.g., simpler UX) for a potential 10-15% lift in trials,
# then drive more users to add items—aligns with B2C SaaS benchmarks for funnel optimization.
