# Null Hypothesis
# The means of the two groups are equal (no difference in session duration between short and long intros), so variants perform the same.

# How much do the observed means deviate from each other?
# t-stat = 6.416 (df=198), well above the critical value threshold of ~1.972
# showing strong deviation between groups—
# this refutes the null hypothesis of no difference in engagement at MasterClass.

# How likely is this result due to chance?
# p-value = 0.000, far below the 0.05 threshold, 
# confirming statistical significance and reinforcing a real (non-random) advantage
# for Variant A over B.

# How strong is the difference?
# Cohen's d = 0.912 falls in the over 0.5 range: large effect.
    # Under 0.2: Negligible (ignore unless huge sample).
    # 0.2-0.5: Small-to-medium (worth exploring, noticeable impact).
    # Over 0.5: Large (clear opportunity to scale).
# Variant A outperforms B substantially—other factors (e.g., user demographics) could fine-tune it even more.

# What direction should we take based on these results?
# With Variant A at 28.87 minutes vs. B at 23.35 minutes (n=100 per group),
# roll out short intros platform-wide immediately to boost retention—could drive 15-20% more subscription renewals
# by cutting early exits, aligning with B2C SaaS benchmarks for high-impact A/B wins.
